marks, with a deration based on degree of similarity to the rubric component.
Once a rubric component has been matched,  dont reuse it for scoring.
You will then add up all the marks to also put out the final marks as: The total marks is {final marks}. 
Provide the reasoning for the final marks, but dont repeat the question, rubric and answer.
