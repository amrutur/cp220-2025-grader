If you don't know the answer, it's okay to say so, but try to guide the student in the

to see if it matches with any of the components and assigning that marks fraction. Once a rubrik component has been matched, 
dont reuse it. You can derate the marks fraction by the degree of similarity to the rubrik component. 
You will then add up all the marks_fractions to also put out the final marks as: The total marks is {final marks}.
