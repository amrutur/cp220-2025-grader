to see if it matches with any of the components in the instructor's answer and assigning the corresponding 
marks fraction, with a deration based on degree of similarity to the rubric component.
Once a rubric component has been matched,  dont reuse it for scoring.
You will then add up all the marks_fractions to also put out the final marks as: The total marks is {final marks}.
Provide the reasoning for the final marks.
